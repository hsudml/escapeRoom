            The circus is today at 5:00pm. It's a surprise for my daughter, Penny. 
            I have a really big deadline this afternoon, but I just can't miss this...
          </p>
          <p>
            Had to reset my passwords yet again! This will barely give me time to get to Penny's school. :(

            Work has been rough lately. Luckily all that work training those slugs will pay off. She'll be really 
            happy and it will be such fun for her class!
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, I've forgotten my passwords again- I think this is my fourth time resetting them...

            The circus is five weeks away. I feel like I just don't have time to do it justice- with the big Mega-Geneti-Corp investigation and everything else. 
            My work training the slugs has been difficult and I haven't been getting much sleep lately.

            Everything is coming along great with the rodeo. I have enough slugs now and things seem to be on track. However, I've been asked to be part of a panel investigating ethics violations by 
            Mega-Genti-Corp. The evidence is pretty damning and extremely confidential- I've had to use a high-security database that is driving me crazy- I have so many passwords to keep track of!

            I'm so excited to start work on the slug rodeo. I've been talking to a few professors who are helping me come up with a training regimen for them. So far, so good!
